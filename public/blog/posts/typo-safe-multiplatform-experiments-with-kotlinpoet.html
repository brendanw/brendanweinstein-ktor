  <h2>Typo-safe multiplatform experiments with Kotlinpoet</h2>
  <p class="date"><i>28 March 2020</i></p>

  <p>A year ago I made a mistake on an experiment I thoroughly tested. It was an experiment to expose different buckets
    of users to different sets of pricing. I tested each variant of the experiment thoroughly, going through the pains
    to make a release build, upload it to the play store, and do end-to-end testing of purchases. And for the last step
    of wrapping up my work I added in what the matching experiment names on the server should be in client code. And I
    made a typo error. We launched the experiment and didn’t catch the error until several weeks later. It was a costly
    mistake, as there were further experiments we wanted to conduct that depended on the results of that experiment.</p>

  <p>Friends shared stories of similar mistakes happening, but with the field name of a variant having the typo. They
    called it fat thumbing. My CTO suggested the best way to avoid the mistake in the future would be to have a location
    where all the experiment names are defined on the client and an endpoint that returns the list of experiment names,
    and run a test to check that all the client-defined names in the experiment exist on the server.</p>

  <p>I thought we could do better. When I start implementing an experiment, I’d like to write code that looks like:</p>

  <pre>
    <code>
val variant = Experiment.PRICING.activeVariant
when (variant) { 
   is CONTROL -> PurchaseActivity.launch(price = variant.price) 
   is A -> PurchaseActivity.launch(price = variant.price, metadata = variant.metadata)
   is B -> PurchaseActivity.launch(price = variant.price) 
}
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>I’d like to type Experiment and then see a list of autocomplete options in the IDE. Once I have a reference to the
    active variant for the user, then I’d like to type a dot and see a list of accessible fields for that variant that
    are strongly typed. My first stab at an implementation looked something like this:</p>

  <pre>
object Experiment { 
   var PRICING = PricingExperiment()  

   class PricingExperiment : Experiment() { 
      val activeVariant: PricingVariant 
      get() {
         return _activeVariant as PricingVariant 
      }      

      sealed class PricingVariant { 
         class CONTROL(val price: Int) : PricingVariant() {} 
         class A(val price: Int, val metadata: String) : PricingVariant() {  }  
         class B(val price: Int) : PricingVariant() {   } 
      } 
   }
    
}  

abstract class Experiment {
   protected var _activeVariant 
   fun updateVariant(variant: JRSUIConstants.Variant) 
}
  </pre>

  <p>The idea is that I’ll write a build task that generates this code. I’ll separately have a client that runs on app
    startup that passes a user id to and endpoint and get a list of experiments that user should be in, the active
    variant for each experiment, and values for individual fields defined for each variant.</p>

  <p>The problem is how do I update the experiments and variants in a thread-safe way. I need to make the network call
    and the logic to populate the new experiments objects on a background thread, and I want to have references to those
    objects on the main thread in a way that guarantees I have the latest version. The approach I took is to make copies
    of experiments and variants when populating on a background thread, and put each of those new copies into a newly
    constructed experiment map. The experimentMap is the only mutable state shared between threads, so we use an
    atomic reference for this one field and get thread safety from all of its references by following copy-on-write.
    Now we have an overall design that looks like this:</p>

  <pre>
object ExperimentRepository { 
   var PRICING: PricingExperiment 
   get() = experimentMap.value[“Pricing”]!! as PricingExperiment  

   val experimentMap: AtomicRef = atomic(
      mapOf( 
         "pricing" to PricingExperiment()   
      )
   )  

   val variantMap: Map = mapOf( 
      VariantKey(“pricing”, “control”) to PricingExperiment.PricingVariant.CONTROL(),
      VariantKey(“pricing”, “a”) to PricingExperiment.PricingVariant.A(),
      VariantKey(“pricing”, “b”) to PricingExperiment.PricingVariant.B() 
   )     
}

abstract class Experiment {
  abstract var name: String,
  abstract var isActive: Boolean,
  abstract var activeVariant: Variant
  abstract fun copy(activeVariant: Variant, isActive: Boolean): Experiment 
}

interface Variant {
  val _name: String
  fun populateFromFieldMap( fieldMap: Map<String, FieldResponse>): Variant
}

data class VariantKey(val name: String, val variantId: String )

data class FieldResponse(
  val type: String,
  val key: String,
  val value: String 
)

class PricingExperiment(
  override var name: String = “pricing”, 
  override var isActive: Boolean = false,
  override var activeVariant: Variant = PricingVariant.CONTROL()
) : Experiment() { 
  val activeVariant: PricingVariant 
    get() { 
      return activeVariant as PricingVariant
    }

  sealed class PricingVariant { 
    class CONTROL(val price: Int) : PricingVariant() {   }
    class A(val price: Int, val metadata: String) : PricingVariant() {  }  
    class B(val price: Int) : PricingVariant() {   } 
  }
}

inline fun <reified T> safeValue(
    value: String?,
    fallbackValue: T
): T {
  if (value == null) return fallbackValue
  return try {
    when (T::class) {
      Int::class -> value.toInt() as T
      Boolean::class -> value.toBoolean() as T
      Float::class -> value.toFloat() as T
      Double::class -> value.toDouble() as T
      else -> throw IllegalArgumentException("${T::class.simpleName} is not supported by safeValue“)
    }
  } catch (e: NumberFormatException) {
    //TODO: Log exception
    fallbackValue
  }
}
